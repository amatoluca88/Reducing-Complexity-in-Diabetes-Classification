# Reducing-Complexity-in-Diabetes-Classification
This project explores the optimization of binary classification for diabetes diagnosis using tree-based machine learning models. By comparing Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, the analysis identifies the most effective balance between model complexity and predictive performance.
